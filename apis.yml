      The Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor API is a fully managed service
      that allows you to customize your billing data each month for accurate
      showback or chargeback to your end customers. It does not alter the way
      you are billed by AWS, but rather enables you to configure, generate, and
      display rates for specific customers during a billing period. You can also
      compare the rates you set to your actual AWS rates. With the API, payer
      accounts can view custom rates on the billing details page or set up cost
      and usage reports per billing group.

      Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a robust container
      management service provided by Amazon. It enables easy running, stopping,
      and management of Docker containers with high scalability and speed.
      Amazon ECS allows you to host your container clusters on a serverless
      infrastructure using Fargate or on Amazon EC2 instances that you manage.
      With Amazon ECS, you can effortlessly launch and stop container-based
      applications through simple API calls and benefit from centralized
      monitoring capabilities and familiar Amazon EC2 features. Additionally,
      Amazon ECS offers advanced scheduling capabilities for placing containers
      based on resource requirements, isolation policies, and availability
      needs. By using Amazon ECS, you can simplify cluster management,
      configuration, and scalability, eliminating the need for your own cluster
      and configuration management systems.

      Amazon ElastiCache is a convenient web service that simplifies the process
      of setting up, operating, and expanding a distributed cache in the cloud.
      By utilizing ElastiCache, users can enjoy the advantages of a
      high-performance, in-memory cache without the extensive administrative
      tasks typically associated with launching and maintaining a distributed
      cache. The service streamlines setup, scaling, and cluster failure
      management compared to a self-managed cache deployment. Additionally,
      Amazon ElastiCache offers integration with Amazon CloudWatch, providing
      users with increased visibility into the important performance metrics of
      their cache and the ability to receive alerts if any parts of their cache
      become overloaded.

      With Amazon EventBridge, you can easily monitor and respond to changes in
      your AWS resources by setting up rules that trigger actions based on
      specific events. Events generated by your resources are sent to an event
      stream, allowing you to create customized rules that match certain events
      and direct them to designated targets for further processing. You can also
      schedule actions to be performed at specific intervals. For example, you
      can automate tasks such as updating DNS entries, analyzing API records for
      security risks, or creating snapshots of EBS volumes.

      The recommended way to interact with the transactional data APIs for
      Amazon QLDB is to use the QLDB driver or the QLDB shell for executing data
      transactions on a ledger. When working with an AWS SDK, it is advised to
      use the QLDB driver, which abstracts the data plane and manages
      SendCommand API calls.

      operates asynchronously, requiring techniques such as polling or
      asynchronous callback handlers to track the status of commands. The
      parameter descriptions in this reference specify whether a change takes
      effect immediately, upon the next instance reboot, or during the next
      maintenance window. Amazon Redshift handles tasks such as provisioning
      capacity, monitoring, backup, and applying patches and upgrades to the
      engine, allowing users to focus on leveraging their data for business
      insights.

      Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a search and discovery service
      that allows users to explore their resources using an internet search
      engine-like experience. Examples of resources that can be searched for
      include Amazon RDS instances, Amazon S3 buckets, and Amazon DynamoDB
      tables. Users can search for resources using metadata such as names, tags,
      and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all AWS Regions in the user's
      account to simplify cross-Region workloads. By turning on Resource
      Explorer, users can scan and index resources in each Region, with the
      option to designate one Region as the aggregator index for the account.
      This aggregator index contains a copy of all resource information from all
      Regions where Resource Explorer is enabled. Users can access a
      comprehensive view of their resources across all indexed Regions in their
      account. For more information on enabling and configuring Resource
      Explorer, refer to the user guide provided by Amazon Web Services.

      The Amazon WorkDocs API is tailored for a variety of use cases, including
      file migration, security applications, and eDiscovery/analytics. The API
      supports file migration applications for users looking to transfer files
      from different systems, while also allowing for basic metadata changes.
      Security applications can utilize the API actions to detect changes in
      WorkDocs and take necessary actions to ensure data security. General
      administrative applications, such as eDiscovery and analytics, can record
      and replicate data from WorkDocs for backup and analysis purposes.
