    <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to
    create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read
    data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between two
    snapshots. If youâ€™re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup
    services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and
    cost-effective to track incremental changes on your Amazon EBS volumes
    through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
    from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
    instances to compare the differences.</p> <p>You can create incremental
    snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the cloud to use
    for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots,
    you can write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then
    after recovery, you can restore it back to Amazon Web Services or
    on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and maintain
    complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p> <p>This API
    reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
    parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about
    the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use
    them effectively, see <a

    the Contents of an Amazon EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute

    Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs, see

      summary: Completesnapshot
      description: >-
        Seals and completes the snapshot after all of the required blocks of
        data have been written to it. Completing the snapshot changes the status
        to completed. You cannot write new blocks to a snapshot after it has
        been completed.  You should always retry requests that receive server
        (5xx) error responses, and ThrottlingException and
        RequestThrottledException client error responses. For more information
        see Error retries in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

      summary: Putsnapshotblock
      description: >-
        Writes a block of data to a snapshot. If the specified block contains
        data, the existing data is overwritten. The target snapshot must be in
        the pending state. Data written to a snapshot must be aligned with
        512-KiB sectors.  You should always retry requests that receive server
        (5xx) error responses, and ThrottlingException and
        RequestThrottledException client error responses. For more information
        see Error retries in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

        Returns information about the blocks that are different between two
        Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshots of the same volume/snapshot
        lineage.  You should always retry requests that receive server (5xx)
        error responses, and ThrottlingException and RequestThrottledException
        client error responses. For more information see Error retries in the

        Returns information about the blocks in an Amazon Elastic Block Store
        snapshot.  You should always retry requests that receive server (5xx)
        error responses, and ThrottlingException and RequestThrottledException
        client error responses. For more information see Error retries in the

        Creates a new Amazon EBS snapshot. The new snapshot enters the pending
        state after the request completes.  After creating the snapshot, use 
        PutSnapshotBlock to write blocks of data to the snapshot.  You should
        always retry requests that receive server (5xx) error responses, and
        ThrottlingException and RequestThrottledException client error
        responses. For more information see Error retries in the Amazon Elastic
