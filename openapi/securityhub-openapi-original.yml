    <p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security
    state in Amazon Web Services and helps you assess your Amazon Web Services
    environment against security industry standards and best practices.</p>
    <p>Security Hub collects security data across Amazon Web Services accounts,
    Amazon Web Services, and supported third-party products and helps you
    analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security
    issues.</p> <p>To help you manage the security state of your organization,
    Security Hub supports multiple security standards. These include the Amazon
    Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed
    by Amazon Web Services, and external compliance frameworks such as the
    Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment Card Industry Data Security
    Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST). Each standard includes several security controls, each of which
    represents a security best practice. Security Hub runs checks against
    security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your
    compliance against security best practices.</p> <p>In addition to generating
    control findings, Security Hub also receives findings from other Amazon Web
    Services, such as Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and supported
    third-party products. This gives you a single pane of glass into a variety
    of security-related issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other
    Amazon Web Services and supported third-party products.</p> <p>Security Hub
    offers automation features that help you triage and remediate security
    issues. For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update
    critical findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the
    integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to
    specific findings.</p> <p>This guide, the <i>Security Hub API Reference</i>,
    provides information about the Security Hub API. This includes supported
    resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas. If you're new to Security
    Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
    <i>Security Hub User Guide</i> </a>. The user guide explains key concepts
    and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features.
    It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub
    with other Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>In addition to interacting with
    Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a current
    version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon Web
    Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code
    for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go, Python,
    C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient, programmatic access
    to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They also handle tasks such
    as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically.
    For information about installing and using the Amazon Web Services tools and
    SDKs, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to Build on
    Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> <p>With the exception of operations that are
    related to central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed
    only in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the
    specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any
    configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied
    only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, call the same
    API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the change. When you
    use central configuration, API requests for enabling Security Hub,
    standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and all linked
    Regions. For a list of central configuration operations, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/central-configuration-intro.html#central-configuration-concepts">Central
    configuration terms and concepts</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User
    Guide</i>.</p> <p>The following throttling limits apply to Security Hub API
    operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> -
