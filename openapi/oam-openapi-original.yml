    <p>Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage
    links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using <i>CloudWatch
    cross-account observability</i>. With CloudWatch cross-account
    observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span
    multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze
    your metrics, logs, traces, and Application Insights applications in any of
    the linked accounts without account boundaries.</p> <p>Set up one or more
    Amazon Web Services accounts as <i>monitoring accounts</i> and link them
    with multiple <i>source accounts</i>. A monitoring account is a central
    Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with observability
    data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual
    Amazon Web Services account that generates observability data for the
    resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their observability data
    with the monitoring account. The shared observability data can include
    metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, traces in
    X-Ray, and applications in Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights.</p>

      description: >-
        Creates a link between a source account and a sink that you have created
        in a monitoring account. Before you create a link, you must create a
        sink in the monitoring account and create a sink policy in that account.
        The sink policy must permit the source account to link to it. You can
        grant permission to source accounts by granting permission to an entire
        organization or to individual accounts. For more information, see
        CreateSink and PutSinkPolicy. Each monitoring account can be linked to
        as many as 100,000 source accounts. Each source account can be linked to
        as many as five monitoring accounts.

        Use this to create a sink in the current account, so that it can be used
        as a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account observability. A
        sink is a resource that represents an attachment point in a monitoring
        account. Source accounts can link to the sink to send observability
        data. After you create a sink, you must create a sink policy that allows
        source accounts to attach to it. For more information, see
        PutSinkPolicy. Each account can contain one sink. If you delete a sink,
        you can then create a new one in that account.
