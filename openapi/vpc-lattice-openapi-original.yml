    <p>Amazon VPC Lattice is a fully managed application networking service that
    you use to connect, secure, and monitor all of your services across multiple
    accounts and virtual private clouds (VPCs). Amazon VPC Lattice interconnects
    your microservices and legacy services within a logical boundary, so that
    you can discover and manage them more efficiently. For more information, see
    the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/">Amazon VPC
    Lattice User Guide</a> </p>

        Every association in Amazon VPC Lattice is given a unique Amazon
        Resource Name (ARN), such as when a service network is associated with a
        VPC or when a service is associated with a service network. If the
        association is for a resource that is shared with another account, the
        association will include the local account ID as the prefix in the ARN
        for each account the resource is shared with.
