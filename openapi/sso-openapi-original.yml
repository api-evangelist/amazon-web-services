    <p>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) Portal is a web
    service that makes it easy for you to assign user access to IAM Identity
    Center resources such as the AWS access portal. Users can get AWS account
    applications and roles assigned to them and get federated into the
    application.</p> <note> <p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the
    <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue
    to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more
    information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM
    Identity Center rename</a>.</p> </note> <p>This reference guide describes
    the IAM Identity Center Portal operations that you can call programatically
    and includes detailed information on data types and errors.</p> <note>
    <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
    programming languages and platforms, such as Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, or
    Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
    IAM Identity Center and other AWS services. For more information about the
    AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
    href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>

      summary: Logout
      description: >-
        Removes the locally stored SSO tokens from the client-side cache and
        sends an API call to the IAM Identity Center service to invalidate the
        corresponding server-side IAM Identity Center sign in session.  If a
        user uses IAM Identity Center to access the AWS CLI, the userâ€™s IAM
        Identity Center sign in session is used to obtain an IAM session, as
        specified in the corresponding IAM Identity Center permission set. More
        specifically, IAM Identity Center assumes an IAM role in the target
        account on behalf of the user, and the corresponding temporary AWS
        credentials are returned to the client. After user logout, any existing
        IAM role sessions that were created by using IAM Identity Center
        permission sets continue based on the duration configured in the
        permission set. For more information, see User authentications in the
        IAM Identity Center User Guide.
