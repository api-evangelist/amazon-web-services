        Amazon Web Services Region where the Amazon Connect instance or traffic
        distribution group was created. For more information about how to use
        this operation, see Claim a phone number in your country and Claim phone
        numbers to traffic distribution groups in the Amazon Connect
        Administrator Guide.   You can call the SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers API
        for available phone numbers that you can claim. Call the
        DescribePhoneNumber API to verify the status of a previous
        ClaimPhoneNumber operation.  If you plan to claim and release numbers
        frequently during a 30 day period, contact us for a service quota
        exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming
        and releasing any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number
        released has expired. By default you can claim and release up to 200% of
        your maximum number of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If
        you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling
        30 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota,
        you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past
        the oldest number released has expired.  For example, if you already
        have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers,
        and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99,
        you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are blocked
        from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services
        support ticket.

        using the GetMetricDataV2 API. It provides more flexibility, features,
        and the ability to query longer time ranges than GetMetricData. Use it
        to retrieve historical agent and contact metrics for the last 3 months,
        at varying intervals. You can also use it to build custom dashboards to
        measure historical queue and agent performance. For example, you can
        track the number of incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data
        split by day, to see how contact volume changed per day of the week.

        where the recording has started and you want to suspend and resume it,
        such as when collecting sensitive information (for example, a credit
        card number), use SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.

        performs the actions in the flow that's specified (in ContactFlowId).
        Agents do not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not
        dial the contact. If the flow places an outbound call to a contact, and
        then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to the agent,
        like any other inbound case. There is a 60-second dialing timeout for
        this operation. If the call is not connected after 60 seconds, it
        fails.  UK numbers with a 447 prefix are not allowed by default. Before
        you can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit a service quota
        increase request. For more information, see Amazon Connect Service
        Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.    Campaign calls are

        RelatedContactId input parameters, note the following:   
        PreviousContactId    Any updates to user-defined task contact attributes
        on any contact linked through the same PreviousContactId will affect
        every contact in the chain.   There can be a maximum of 12 linked task
        contacts in a chain. That is, 12 task contacts can be created that share
        the same PreviousContactId.      RelatedContactId    Copies contact
        attributes from the related task contact to the new contact.   Any
        update on attributes in a new task contact does not update attributes on
        previous contact.   There’s no limit on the number of task contacts that
        can be created that use the same RelatedContactId.     In addition, when
        calling StartTaskContact include only one of these parameters:
        ContactFlowID, QuickConnectID, or TaskTemplateID. Only one parameter is
        required as long as the task template has a flow configured to run it.
        If more than one parameter is specified, or only the TaskTemplateID is
        specified but it does not have a flow configured, the request returns an
        error because Amazon Connect cannot identify the unique flow to run when
        the task is created. A ServiceQuotaExceededException occurs when the
        number of open tasks exceeds the active tasks quota or there are already
        12 tasks referencing the same PreviousContactId. For more information

        This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to

        and QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds). These properties can be used to
        change a customer's position in the queue. For example, you can move a
        contact to the back of the queue by setting a lower routing priority
        relative to other contacts in queue; or you can move a contact to the
        front of the queue by increasing the routing age which will make the
        contact look artificially older and therefore higher up in the
        first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the routing age of
        a contact affects only its position in queue, and not its actual queue
