        want to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon Web
        Services account with a private hosted zone that was created by using a
        different account, the Amazon Web Services account that created the

        the VPC must submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request.   When
        granting access, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to the
        same partition. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions.
        Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition. The
        following are the supported partitions:    aws - Amazon Web Services
        Regions    aws-cn - China Regions    aws-us-gov - Amazon Web Services

      summary: Changeresourcerecordsets
      description: >-
        Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains
        authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain
        name. For example, you can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a
        resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web
        server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.  Deleting Resource Record
        Sets  To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same
        values that you specified when you created it.  Change Batches and
        Transactional Changes  The request body must include a document with a
        ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a
        list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are
        considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the
        request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change
        batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by
        partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone.  For
        example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes
        the CNAME resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias
        resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records
        succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the
        second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for
        either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then the request is
        canceled, and the original CNAME record continues to exist.  If you try
        to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change
        batch, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.   Traffic Flow  To
        create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use
        either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API
        actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the
        configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy
        with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names
        (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted
        zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't
        performing as expected. For more information, see Using Traffic Flow to
        Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Create,
        Delete, and Upsert  Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the
        following actions:    CREATE: Creates a resource record set that has the
        specified values.    DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set
        that has the specified values.    UPSERT: If a resource set doesn't
        exist, Route 53 creates it. If a resource set exists Route 53 updates it
        with the values in the request.     Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and
        Deleting Resource Record Sets  The syntax for a request depends on the
        type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update,
        such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request
        must appear in the order listed in the syntax.  For an example for each
        type of resource record set, see "Examples." Don't refer to the syntax
        in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements
        for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or
        update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets.   Change Propagation to Route
        53 DNS Servers  When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request,
        Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative
        DNS servers managing the hosted zone. While your changes are
        propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is
        complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally
        propagate to all Route 53 name servers managing the hosted zone within
        60 seconds. For more information, see GetChange.  Limits on
        ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests  For information about the limits on a
        ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits in the Amazon Route 53

        Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order. The
        response includes a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone
        created by the current Amazon Web Services account.  
        ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted zones by name with the labels
        reversed. For example:  com.example.www.  Note the trailing dot, which
        can change the sort order in some circumstances. If the domain name
        includes escape characters or Punycode, ListHostedZonesByName
        alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or Punycoded value, which
        is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example,
        to create a hosted zone for exämple.com, you specify ex\344mple.com for
        the domain name. ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes it as: 
        com.ex\344mple.  The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the
        escaped value. For more information about valid domain name formats,
        including internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in
        the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Route 53 returns up to 100 items in
        each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, use the MaxItems
        parameter to list them in groups of up to 100. The response includes
        values that help navigate from one group of MaxItems hosted zones to the
        next:   The DNSName and HostedZoneId elements in the response contain
        the values, if any, specified for the dnsname and hostedzoneid
        parameters in the request that produced the current response.   The
        MaxItems element in the response contains the value, if any, that you
        specified for the maxitems parameter in the request that produced the
        current response.   If the value of IsTruncated in the response is true,
        there are more hosted zones associated with the current Amazon Web
        Services account.  If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the
        last hosted zone that is associated with the current account. The
        NextDNSName element and NextHostedZoneId elements are omitted from the
        response.   The NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements in the
        response contain the domain name and the hosted zone ID of the next
        hosted zone that is associated with the current Amazon Web Services
        account. If you want to list more hosted zones, make another call to
        ListHostedZonesByName, and specify the value of NextDNSName and
        NextHostedZoneId in the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters,
        respectively.

        Services service owns the hosted zones. The HostedZoneOwner structure in
        the response contains one of the following values:   An OwningAccount
        element, which contains the account number of either the current Amazon
        Web Services account or another Amazon Web Services account. Some
        services, such as Cloud Map, create hosted zones using the current
        account.    An OwningService element, which identifies the Amazon Web
        Services service that created and owns the hosted zone. For example, if
        a hosted zone was created by Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS),
        the value of Owner is efs.amazonaws.com.     When listing private hosted
        zones, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to the same
        partition where the hosted zones were created. A partition is a group of
        Amazon Web Services Regions. Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped
        to one partition. The following are the supported partitions:    aws -
        Amazon Web Services Regions    aws-cn - China Regions    aws-us-gov -

        To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets
        for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a
        ChangeResourceRecordSets request while you're paging through the results
        of a ListResourceRecordSets request. If you do, some pages may display
        results without the latest changes while other pages display results
        with the latest changes.  Displaying the next page of results  If a
        ListResourceRecordSets command returns more than one page of results,
        the value of IsTruncated is true. To display the next page of results,
        get the values of NextRecordName, NextRecordType, and
        NextRecordIdentifier (if any) from the response. Then submit another
        ListResourceRecordSets request, and specify those values for
        StartRecordName, StartRecordType, and StartRecordIdentifier.
