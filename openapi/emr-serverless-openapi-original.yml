        Creates and returns a URL that you can use to access the application UIs
        for a job run. For jobs in a running state, the application UI is a live
        user interface such as the Spark or Tez web UI. For completed jobs, the
        application UI is a persistent application user interface such as the
        Spark History Server or persistent Tez UI.  The URL is valid for one
        hour after you generate it. To access the application UI after that hour
        elapses, you must invoke the API again to generate a new URL.
