    PUT:
      summary: Associatealias
      description: >-
        Associates an alias (also known as a CNAME or an alternate domain name)
        with a CloudFront distribution. With this operation you can move an
        alias that's already in use on a CloudFront distribution to a different
        distribution in one step. This prevents the downtime that could occur if
        you first remove the alias from one distribution and then separately add
        the alias to another distribution. To use this operation to associate an
        alias with a distribution, you provide the alias and the ID of the
        target distribution for the alias. For more information, including how
        to set up the target distribution, prerequisites that you must complete,
        and other restrictions, see Moving an alternate domain name to a
        different distribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

        Creates a staging distribution using the configuration of the provided
        primary distribution. A staging distribution is a copy of an existing
        distribution (called the primary distribution) that you can use in a
        continuous deployment workflow. After you create a staging distribution,
        you can use UpdateDistribution to modify the staging distribution's
        configuration. Then you can use CreateContinuousDeploymentPolicy to
        incrementally move traffic to the staging distribution. This API

        Gets a response headers policy configuration. To get a response headers
        policy configuration, you must provide the policy's identifier. If the
        response headers policy is attached to a distribution's cache behavior,
        you can get the policy's identifier using ListDistributions or
        GetDistribution. If the response headers policy is not attached to a
        cache behavior, you can get the identifier using
        ListResponseHeadersPolicies.

      summary: Listconflictingaliases
      description: >-
        Gets a list of aliases (also called CNAMEs or alternate domain names)
        that conflict or overlap with the provided alias, and the associated
        CloudFront distributions and Amazon Web Services accounts for each
        conflicting alias. In the returned list, the distribution and account
        IDs are partially hidden, which allows you to identify the distributions
        and accounts that you own, but helps to protect the information of ones
        that you don't own. Use this operation to find aliases that are in use
        in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For
        example, if you provide www.example.com as input, the returned list can
        include www.example.com and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain
        name (*.example.com), if they exist. If you provide *.example.com as
        input, the returned list can include *.example.com and any alternate
        domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, www.example.com,
        test.example.com, dev.example.com, and so on), if they exist. To list
        conflicting aliases, you provide the alias to search and the ID of a
        distribution in your account that has an attached SSL/TLS certificate
        that includes the provided alias. For more information, including how to
        set up the distribution and certificate, see Moving an alternate domain
        name to a different distribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer
        Guide. You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive
        in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the
        maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is
        paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that
        specifies the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
        value in the subsequent request.

        Tests a CloudFront function. To test a function, you provide an event
        object that represents an HTTP request or response that your CloudFront
        distribution could receive in production. CloudFront runs the function,
        passing it the event object that you provided, and returns the
        function's result (the modified event object) in the response. The
        response also contains function logs and error messages, if any exist.
        For more information about testing functions, see Testing functions in
        the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. To test a function, you provide
        the function's name and version (ETag value) along with the event

        Copies the staging distribution's configuration to its corresponding
        primary distribution. The primary distribution retains its Aliases (also
        known as alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and
        ContinuousDeploymentPolicyId value, but otherwise its configuration is
        overwritten to match the staging distribution. You can use this
        operation in a continuous deployment workflow after you have tested
        configuration changes on the staging distribution. After using a
        continuous deployment policy to move a portion of your domain name's
        traffic to the staging distribution and verifying that it works as
        intended, you can use this operation to copy the staging distribution's
        configuration to the primary distribution. This action will disable the
        continuous deployment policy and move your domain's traffic back to the
