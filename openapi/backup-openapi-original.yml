        period for future backup and copy jobs that target a backup vault. 
        Backup Vault Lock has been assessed by Cohasset Associates for use in
        environments that are subject to SEC 17a-4, CFTC, and FINRA regulations.

        expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according
        to the lifecycle that you define. Backups transitioned to cold storage
        must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the
        “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold
        after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot
        be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold. Resource types
        that are able to be transitioned to cold storage are listed in the
        "Lifecycle to cold storage" section of the  Feature availability by
        resource table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.
