    <p>Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers
    who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data
    types, and errors. </p> <p>Audit Manager is a service that provides
    automated evidence collection so that you can continually audit your Amazon
    Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the effectiveness of your
    controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance.</p> <p>Audit Manager
    provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a
    given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of
    controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are
    grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard
    or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support
    internal audits with specific requirements. </p> <p>Use the following links

        Deletes an assessment report in Audit Manager.  When you run the
        DeleteAssessmentReport operation, Audit Manager attempts to delete the
        following data:   The specified assessment report that’s stored in your
        S3 bucket   The associated metadata that’s stored in Audit Manager   If
        Audit Manager can’t access the assessment report in your S3 bucket, the
        report isn’t deleted. In this event, the DeleteAssessmentReport
        operation doesn’t fail. Instead, it proceeds to delete the associated
        metadata only. You must then delete the assessment report from the S3
        bucket yourself.  This scenario happens when Audit Manager receives a
        403 (Forbidden) or 404 (Not Found) error from Amazon S3. To avoid this,
        make sure that your S3 bucket is available, and that you configured the
        correct permissions for Audit Manager to delete resources in your S3
        bucket. For an example permissions policy that you can use, see
        Assessment report destination permissions in the Audit Manager User
        Guide. For information about the issues that could cause a 403
        (Forbidden) or 404 (Not Found) error from Amazon S3, see List of Error
        Codes in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference.

      description: >-
        Removes the specified Amazon Web Services account as a delegated
        administrator for Audit Manager.  When you remove a delegated
        administrator from your Audit Manager settings, you continue to have
        access to the evidence that you previously collected under that account.
        This is also the case when you deregister a delegated administrator from
        Organizations. However, Audit Manager stops collecting and attaching
        evidence to that delegated administrator account moving forward.  Keep
        in mind the following cleanup task if you use evidence finder: Before
        you use your management account to remove a delegated administrator,
        make sure that the current delegated administrator account signs in to
        Audit Manager and disables evidence finder first. Disabling evidence
        finder automatically deletes the event data store that was created in
        their account when they enabled evidence finder. If this task isn’t
        completed, the event data store remains in their account. In this case,
        we recommend that the original delegated administrator goes to
        CloudTrail Lake and manually deletes the event data store. This cleanup
        task is necessary to ensure that you don't end up with multiple event
        data stores. Audit Manager ignores an unused event data store after you
        remove or change a delegated administrator account. However, the unused
        event data store continues to incur storage costs from CloudTrail Lake
        if you don't delete it.  When you deregister a delegated administrator
        account for Audit Manager, the data for that account isn’t deleted. If
        you want to delete resource data for a delegated administrator account,
        you must perform that task separately before you deregister the account.
        Either, you can do this in the Audit Manager console. Or, you can use
        one of the delete API operations that are provided by Audit Manager.  To
        delete your Audit Manager resource data, see the following
        instructions:     DeleteAssessment (see also: Deleting an assessment in
        the Audit Manager User Guide)    DeleteAssessmentFramework (see also:
        Deleting a custom framework in the Audit Manager User Guide)   
        DeleteAssessmentFrameworkShare (see also: Deleting a share request in
        the Audit Manager User Guide)    DeleteAssessmentReport (see also:
        Deleting an assessment report in the Audit Manager User Guide)   
        DeleteControl (see also: Deleting a custom control in the Audit Manager
        User Guide)   At this time, Audit Manager doesn't provide an option to
        delete evidence for a specific delegated administrator. Instead, when
        your management account deregisters Audit Manager, we perform a cleanup
        for the current delegated administrator account at the time of
        deregistration.

Recipients have 120 days to accept or decline the request. If no action is taken, the share request expires. When you create a share request, Audit Manager stores a snapshot of your custom framework in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web Services Region. Audit Manager also stores a backup of the same snapshot in the US West (Oregon) Amazon Web Services Region. Audit Manager deletes the snapshot and the backup snapshot when one of the following events occurs:   The sender revokes the share request.   The recipient declines the share request.   The recipient encounters an error and doesn''t successfully accept the share request.   The share request expires before the recipient responds to the request.   When a sender resends a share request, the snapshot is replaced with an updated version that corresponds with the latest version of the custom framework.  When a recipient accepts a share request, the snapshot is replicated into their Amazon Web Services account under the Amazon Web Services Region that was specified in the share request.   When you invoke the StartAssessmentFrameworkShare API, you are about to share a custom framework with another Amazon Web Services account. You may not share a custom framework that is derived from a standard framework if the standard framework is designated as not eligible for sharing by Amazon Web Services, unless you have obtained permission to do so from the owner of the standard framework.
