        Sends an email message. You can use the Amazon SES API v2 to send the
        following types of messages:    Simple – A standard email message. When
        you create this type of message, you specify the sender, the recipient,
        and the message body, and Amazon SES assembles the message for you.   
        Raw – A raw, MIME-formatted email message. When you send this type of
        email, you have to specify all of the message headers, as well as the
        message body. You can use this message type to send messages that
        contain attachments. The message that you specify has to be a valid MIME
        message.    Templated – A message that contains personalization tags.
        When you send this type of email, Amazon SES API v2 automatically
        replaces the tags with values that you specify.
