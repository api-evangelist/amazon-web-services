    <p>Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console
    designed to help users mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their
    Amazon Web Services-hosted applications. An incident is any unplanned
    interruption or reduction in quality of services. </p> <p>Incident Manager
    increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact,
    highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration
    tools to get services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of
    reducing the time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager
    automates response plans and enables responder team escalation. </p>
