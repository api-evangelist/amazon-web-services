  /properties:
    POST:
      summary: Batchputassetpropertyvalue
      description: >-
        Sends a list of asset property values to IoT SiteWise. Each value is a
        timestamp-quality-value (TQV) data point. For more information, see
        Ingesting data using the API in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. To identify
        an asset property, you must specify one of the following:   The assetId
        and propertyId of an asset property.   A propertyAlias, which is a data
        stream alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature).
        To define an asset property's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty.    With
        respect to Unix epoch time, IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a
        timestamp of no more than 7 days in the past and no more than 10 minutes
        in the future. IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive
        range of [-7 days, +10 minutes] and returns a
        TimestampOutOfRangeException error. For each asset property, IoT
        SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV
        has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV {T1, GOOD, V1},
        then storing {T1, GOOD, V2} replaces the existing TQV.  IoT SiteWise
        authorizes access to each BatchPutAssetPropertyValue entry individually.
        For more information, see BatchPutAssetPropertyValue authorization in
        the IoT SiteWise User Guide.

        Updates an asset model and all of the assets that were created from the
        model. Each asset created from the model inherits the updated asset
        model's property and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see
        Updating assets and models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide.  This
        operation overwrites the existing model with the provided model. To
        avoid deleting your asset model's properties or hierarchies, you must
        include their IDs and definitions in the updated asset model payload.
        For more information, see DescribeAssetModel. If you remove a property
        from an asset model, IoT SiteWise deletes all previous data for that
        property. If you remove a hierarchy definition from an asset model, IoT
        SiteWise disassociates every asset associated with that hierarchy. You
        can't change the type or data type of an existing property.

        of an existing property. To replace an existing composite asset model
        property with a new one with the same name, do the following:   Submit
        an UpdateAssetModelCompositeModel request with the entire existing
        property removed.   Submit a second UpdateAssetModelCompositeModel
        request that includes the new property. The new asset property will have
