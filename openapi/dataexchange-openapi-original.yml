    <p>AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to
    exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange APIs to
    create, update, manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS Cloud.</p>
    <p>As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an
    entitlement to through a subscription. You can use the APIs to download or
    copy your entitled data sets to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
    for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning services.</p>
    <p>As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would
    like to publish to a product. Being able to package and provide your data
    sets into products requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more
    information, visit the <i>AWS Data Exchange User Guide</i>.</p> <p>A data
    set is a collection of data that can be changed or updated over time. Data
    sets can be updated using revisions, which represent a new version or
    incremental change to a data set. A revision contains one or more assets. An
    asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can be stored as an
    Amazon S3 object, Redshift datashare, API Gateway API, AWS Lake Formation
    data permission, or Amazon S3 data access. The asset can be a structured
    data file, an image file, or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous
    import or export operations used to create or copy assets.</p>
