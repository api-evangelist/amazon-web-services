    <p>This is the Amazon Lookout for Vision API Reference. It provides
    descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common
    errors.</p> <p>Amazon Lookout for Vision enables you to find visual defects
    in industrial products, accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to
    identify missing components in an industrial product, damage to vehicles or
    structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects
    in silicon wafers â€” or any other physical item where quality is important
    such as a missing capacitor on printed circuit boards.</p>

        Creates a new dataset in an Amazon Lookout for Vision project.
        CreateDataset can create a training or a test dataset from a valid
        dataset source (DatasetSource). If you want a single dataset project,
        specify train for the value of DatasetType. To have a project with
        separate training and test datasets, call CreateDataset twice. On the
        first call, specify train for the value of DatasetType. On the second
        call, specify test for the value of DatasetType.  This operation
        requires permissions to perform the lookoutvision:CreateDataset
        operation.

    POST:
      summary: Detectanomalies
      description: >-
        Detects anomalies in an image that you supply.  The response from
        DetectAnomalies includes a boolean prediction that the image contains
        one or more anomalies and a confidence value for the prediction. If the
        model is an image segmentation model, the response also includes
        segmentation information for each type of anomaly found in the image. 
        Before calling DetectAnomalies, you must first start your model with the
        StartModel operation. You are charged for the amount of time, in
        minutes, that a model runs and for the number of anomaly detection units
        that your model uses. If you are not using a model, use the StopModel
        operation to stop your model.   For more information, see Detecting
        anomalies in an image in the Amazon Lookout for Vision developer guide.

        Adds or updates one or more JSON Line entries in a dataset. A JSON Line
        includes information about an image used for training or testing an
        Amazon Lookout for Vision model. To update an existing JSON Line, use
        the source-ref field to identify the JSON Line. The JSON line that you
        supply replaces the existing JSON line. Any existing annotations that
        are not in the new JSON line are removed from the dataset.  For more
        information, see Defining JSON lines for anomaly classification in the
        Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.   The images you reference in
        the source-ref field of a JSON line, must be in the same S3 bucket as
        the existing images in the dataset.   Updating a dataset might take a
        while to complete. To check the current status, call DescribeDataset and
        check the Status field in the response. This operation requires
        permissions to perform the lookoutvision:UpdateDatasetEntries operation.

      description: >-
        Starts an Amazon Lookout for Vision model packaging job. A model
        packaging job creates an AWS IoT Greengrass component for a Lookout for
        Vision model. You can use the component to deploy your model to an edge
        device managed by Greengrass.  Use the DescribeModelPackagingJob API to
        determine the current status of the job. The model packaging job is
        complete if the value of Status is SUCCEEDED. To deploy the component to
        the target device, use the component name and component version with the
        AWS IoT Greengrass CreateDeployment API. This operation requires the
        following permissions:    lookoutvision:StartModelPackagingJob

        Starting a model takes a while to complete. To check the current state
        of the model, use DescribeModel. A model is ready to use when its status
        is HOSTED. Once the model is running, you can detect custom labels in
        new images by calling DetectAnomalies.  You are charged for the amount
        of time that the model is running. To stop a running model, call
        StopModel.  This operation requires permissions to perform the
