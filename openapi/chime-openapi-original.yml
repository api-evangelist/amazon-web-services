    interface (API) is designed so administrators can perform key tasks, such as
    creating and managing Amazon Chime accounts, users, and Voice Connectors.
    This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API,
    including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes.</p> <p>You
    can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST
    API to make API calls for Amazon Chime. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the
    AWS CLI. The page for each API action contains a <i>See Also</i> section
    that includes links to information about using the action with a
    language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.</p> <dl> <dt>Using an AWS SDK</dt>
    <dd> <p> You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request
    authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access
    keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the <a
    href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/">AWS Developer Center</a>. </p> </dd>
    <dt>Using the AWS CLI</dt> <dd> <p>Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to
    make API calls. For information about setting up the AWS CLI, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">Installing
    the AWS Command Line Interface</a> in the <i>AWS Command Line Interface User

    Chime commands</a> in the <i>AWS CLI Command Reference</i>. </p> </dd>
    <dt>Using REST APIs</dt> <dd> <p>If you use REST to make API calls, you must
    authenticate your request by providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports
    Signature Version 4. For more information, see <a

    Version 4 Signing Process</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General

    <code>chime</code> and REST endpoint
