    <p><fullname>Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack</fullname> <p>You can
    use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your support
    cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account. After you configure
    your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Services Support App,
    you can perform the following tasks directly in your Slack channel:</p> <ul>
    <li> <p>Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases</p> </li>
    <li> <p>Request service quota increases for your account</p> </li> <li>
    <p>Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that you can
    chat directly about your support cases</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more
    information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see the following
    documentation in the <i>Amazon Web Services Support User Guide</i>:</p> <ul>

        Creates a Slack channel configuration for your Amazon Web Services
        account.    You can add up to 5 Slack workspaces for your account.   You
        can add up to 20 Slack channels for your account.    A Slack channel can
        have up to 100 Amazon Web Services accounts. This means that only 100
        accounts can add the same Slack channel to the Amazon Web Services
        Support App. We recommend that you only add the accounts that you need
        to manage support cases for your organization. This can reduce the
        notifications about case updates that you receive in the Slack channel. 
        We recommend that you choose a private Slack channel so that only
        members in that channel have read and write access to your support
        cases. Anyone in your Slack channel can create, update, or resolve
        support cases for your account. Users require an invitation to join
        private channels.

        Registers a Slack workspace for your Amazon Web Services account. To
        call this API, your account must be part of an organization in
        Organizations. If you're the management account and you want to register
        Slack workspaces for your organization, you must complete the following
        tasks:   Sign in to the Amazon Web Services Support Center and authorize
        the Slack workspaces where you want your organization to have access to.
        See Authorize a Slack workspace in the Amazon Web Services Support User
        Guide.   Call the RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization API to authorize
        each Slack workspace for the organization.   After the management
        account authorizes the Slack workspace, member accounts can call this
        API to authorize the same Slack workspace for their individual accounts.
        Member accounts don't need to authorize the Slack workspace manually
        through the Amazon Web Services Support Center. To use the Amazon Web
        Services Support App, each account must then complete the following
        tasks:   Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the
        required permission. For more information, see Managing access to the
        Amazon Web Services Support App.   Configure a Slack channel to use the
        Amazon Web Services Support App for support cases for that account. For
        more information, see Configuring a Slack channel.
