      summary: Completeattachmentupload
      description: >-
        Allows you to confirm that the attachment has been uploaded using the
        pre-signed URL provided in StartAttachmentUpload API.    ConnectionToken

  /participant/connection:
    POST:
      summary: Createparticipantconnection
      description: >-
        Creates the participant's connection.    ParticipantToken is used for
        invoking this API instead of ConnectionToken.  The participant token is
        valid for the lifetime of the participant â€“ until they are part of a
        contact. The response URL for WEBSOCKET Type has a connect expiry
        timeout of 100s. Clients must manually connect to the returned websocket
        URL and subscribe to the desired topic.  For chat, you need to publish
        the following on the established websocket connection: 
        {"topic":"aws/subscribe","content":{"topics":["aws/chat"]}}  Upon
        websocket URL expiry, as specified in the response ConnectionExpiry
        parameter, clients need to call this API again to obtain a new websocket
        URL and perform the same steps as before.  Message streaming support:
        This API can also be used together with the StartContactStreaming API to
        create a participant connection for chat contacts that are not using a
        websocket. For more information about message streaming, Enable
        real-time chat message streaming in the Amazon Connect Administrator
        Guide.  Feature specifications: For information about feature
        specifications, such as the allowed number of open websocket connections
        per participant, see Feature specifications in the Amazon Connect
        Administrator Guide.   The Amazon Connect Participant Service APIs do
        not use Signature Version 4 authentication.
