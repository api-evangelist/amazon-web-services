### AWS Billing Conductor

The Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor API is a fully managed service
that allows you to customize your billing data each month for accurate
showback or chargeback to your end customers. It does not alter the way
you are billed by AWS, but rather enables you to configure, generate, and
display rates for specific customers during a billing period. You can also
compare the rates you set to your actual AWS rates. With the API, payer
accounts can view custom rates on the billing details page or set up cost
and usage reports per billing group.
